This is yet another fork of Luke's repo. My very personalized *voidrice*. I'm still using a lot of Luke's program, but with some addition like ```Yazi```, Primeagen's ```init.lua```, ```Catgirl```, and more.

I'm planning to sync this with git, so any updates I've done I could directly push it to my repo, thus my another machine could pull it.
